## :white_check_mark: About The To Do List App 

I'd been wanting to make a to-do-list app for a while and I am really happy with the outcome of this one. I spent quite a bit of time on the design and I'm really pleased with how it looks. 

I got it working fairly quickly but there was quite a lot of repetition in my code and I didn't have the data stored in a very efficient way. 

With a little help, I did a big refactor! I've changed the data structure so that the items are now stored in an array (rather than as HTML strings) and that allowed me to store and access the data more efficiently. I learnt a lot during the refactoring process.

</br></br>

### :mortar_board: Main Learning Points:

- First time using React to build a proper project, so learned to take it slow and study documentation/google when needed. 

- Learned about breaking the problem and tackling one bit of the app at a time. 

- Make sure to console log a lot and read errors/ not be afraid of them when they come up. 

- How to pass down props and leanred more about CSS Styling.
